## To Start
We use `npm@5` to lock versions.
```
npm install
```
and then run
```
npm run dev
```

## To Optimize Images
Many of the pngs you get from online are large and poorly compressed.  To optimize images (on OSX), first install these two programs
```
brew install optipng
brew install jpegoptim
```

Then run
```
pushd dist/images
sips -Z 640 *.png  # resize png (biggest images)
optipng *.png  # optimize png
jpegoptim *.jpg  # optimize jpg
popd
```

## To Deploy
First, build the deploy
```
npm run build
npm run export
```

and then run the deploy script to deploy (check the script for any pre-requisites).
```
./deploy.sh
```

The deploy script relies on two remotes:
- *origin*: (this one, [git@github.com:tianhuil/tianhuil.git]) and
- *deploy*: (where the website is deployed  [git@github.com:tianhuil/tianhuil.github.io.git])
